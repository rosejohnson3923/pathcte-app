## Architecture Decisions Made

### Service Layer (Platform-Agnostic)
All game logic lives in `shared/services/`:
- ✅ No DOM dependencies
- ✅ No React dependencies
- ✅ Pure TypeScript
- ✅ Works for web and future mobile

### State Management (Zustand)
- ✅ Simple, predictable state updates
- ✅ Works identically in React Native
- ✅ No context complexity
- ✅ Easy to debug

### Real-time Architecture
- ✅ Supabase real-time subscriptions
- ✅ Presence tracking
- ✅ Broadcast for custom events
- ✅ Automatic reconnection

### Scoring System
- Base: 10 tokens participation
- Score: +1 token per 10 points
- Placement: 1st: +50, 2nd: +30, 3rd: +20
- Pathkeys: Top 3 finishers (if registered)
- Speed Bonus: Up to +50% points for fast answers

## Technical Debt / Notes

### Known Issues
- [ ] Need to handle player disconnects during gameplay
- [ ] Need timer cleanup on component unmount
- [ ] Need to prevent duplicate answer submissions
- [ ] Should add reconnection logic for dropped connections

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add game chat/reactions
- [ ] Add sound effects
- [ ] Add animations (Framer Motion)
- [ ] Add confetti for winners
- [ ] Add profile pictures in player list
- [ ] Add game history/replays

### Testing Needs
- [ ] Unit tests for game.service.ts
- [ ] Unit tests for scoring logic
- [ ] Integration tests for real-time subscriptions
- [ ] E2E test for full game flow
- [ ] Load testing (50+ players)

## Next Session Plan

### Option A: Complete All Components (12-15 hours)
Continue building all remaining UI components:
1. HostGamePage
2. HostControls
3. QuestionDisplay
4. Leaderboard
5. GameResults
6. Game page container
7. Router integration
8. End-to-end testing

**Benefit:** Full game system complete
**Timeline:** 1-2 more sessions of this length

### Option B: Build MVP Flow First (6-8 hours)
Build just enough for a working demo:
1. HostGamePage (simplified)
2. QuestionDisplay (basic)
3. Leaderboard (basic)
4. Game page container
5. Router setup
6. Basic testing

**Benefit:** Working demo faster, iterate based on feedback
**Timeline:** Can complete in next session

### Option C: Test What We Have (2-3 hours)
Before building more UI:
1. Add routes for current pages
2. Test join game flow
3. Test lobby real-time updates
4. Verify services work correctly
5. Document any bugs/issues

**Benefit:** Validate architecture before continuing
**Timeline:** Quick validation

---

## Recommendation

**I recommend Option B: MVP Flow First**

Reasoning:
1. We have solid backend (services + store)
2. We have join flow + lobby working
3. Build simplified versions of remaining components
4. Get to a working end-to-end demo quickly
5. Iterate and polish based on actual usage

This gets us to a **working multiplayer game** in the next session, then we can polish and add features.

## Questions for Review

1. **Scoring algorithm:** Is the speed bonus (up to 50%) appropriate? Too much/little?

2. **Pathkey rewards:** Currently random pathkey for top 3. Should it be:
   - Related to question topic/career?
   - Specific pathkey set for winning?
   - Multiple pathkeys for 1st place?

3. **Player limits:** Default max 50 players. Is this right for classroom size?

4. **Game flow:** Should there be:
   - Countdown before each question?
   - Break between questions to show leaderboard?
   - Time between questions for discussion?

5. **Disconnection handling:** What happens if:
   - Host disconnects? (auto-assign new host? end game?)
   - Player disconnects mid-game? (keep score, let rejoin?)

Please review and advise on next steps.
