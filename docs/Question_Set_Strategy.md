**Features:**
- Uses OpenAI/Claude to generate questions
- Takes career data from `careers` table in Supabase
- Generates both Career Quest and Explore Careers sets

- O*NET code (for accurate data)
- Sector/industry
- Education requirements
- Median salary
- Job outlook
- Skills required
- Day-in-life description
- Work environment

### Step 3: Generation Priority

2. **Week 2:** Create Tier 1 Explore Careers sets (20 top careers = 40 sets)
3. **Week 3:** Create Tier 2 Explore Careers sets (remaining 30 careers = 60 sets)

### Step 4: Quality Assurance
- Review generated questions for accuracy

- Ensure grade-appropriate language
- Verify all questions have clear correct answers
- Check for biases or stereotypes

COMMENT ON COLUMN question_sets.career_id IS 'Links to specific career for Explore Careers sets';
COMMENT ON COLUMN question_sets.question_set_type IS 'Type of question set (career_quest for multiplayer, explore_careers for solo)';
```

### Indexes for Performance

## Why Scenario-Based Questions for Explore Careers?

**Educational Benefits:**
1. ✅ **Experiential Learning** - Students "try out" careers through realistic scenarios
2. ✅ **Career Reality Check** - Reveals what professionals actually face day-to-day
3. ✅ **Critical Thinking** - Develops professional judgment and decision-making skills
4. ✅ **Memorable** - Scenarios are more engaging than dry facts
5. ✅ **Soft Skills** - Teaches communication, ethics, teamwork, time management
6. ✅ **Self-Assessment** - Students discover if they'd enjoy the career's challenges
7. ✅ **Professional Mindset** - Builds career maturity and workplace readiness

**Example:** Instead of asking "What does a nurse do?", students experience:
- *"Three patients need you at once - how do you triage?"*
- *"A patient refuses medication - how do you handle it?"*
- *"You spotted a colleague's error - what's your responsibility?"*

This approach transforms career exploration from **memorization** into **immersive experience**.
