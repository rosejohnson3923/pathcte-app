## ELEVATOR PITCHES

### 30-Second Pitch (Teacher/Counselor)
"PathCTE is a gamified career exploration platform that makes CTE engaging. Students play 20+ educational game modes to unlock Pathkeys representing 1,000+ careers. Teachers get real-time analytics on student interests and progress. Think Blooket meets career counseling - students actually want to do their career homework."

### 60-Second Pitch (Administrator)
"PathCTE solves the CTE engagement problem. Traditional career exploration is boring - students take one interest inventory and forget it. PathCTE turns career discovery into an addictive game. Students collect Pathkeys, compete in live games, and explore careers through gameplay. For educators, we provide comprehensive analytics showing exactly which careers students are interested in, supporting Perkins V reporting, and demonstrating CTE program effectiveness. Districts see increased CTE enrollment because students are genuinely excited about career exploration. Pricing starts at $3 per student per year."

### 2-Minute Pitch (Investor)
"The US spends $1.3 billion annually on CTE programs through Perkins V funding, but student engagement is abysmal. School counselors have 482 students each and can't provide personalized career guidance. Students graduate without exploring career options beyond doctor, lawyer, teacher.

PathCTE transforms career exploration into a gaming experience. Students play multiplayer games to unlock Pathkeys - collectible digital keys representing careers. As they unlock careers, they learn about education requirements, salaries, daily tasks, and job outlook. It's designed to be as addictive as video games but with educational purpose.

For educators, PathCTE provides analytics showing which careers each student explores, tracking career readiness, and supporting compliance reporting. Teachers love it because students actually complete career homework voluntarily.

We've designed for mobile-first from day one. The web app launches first, then native iOS and Android apps follow with 70% code reuse.

Business model: Freemium with students free, teachers pay $3-8/student/year based on features. Enterprise licenses for districts. Future revenue from career partnerships, sponsored content, and premium career resources.

Market: 15 million US high school students, 8 million middle school students in CTE programs. $300M TAM in US, $1B+ globally.

We're seeking $2M seed round to complete product development, hire sales team, and acquire first 100 school districts."

## APPENDIX: PRONUNCIATION VARIATIONS

### How People Might Naturally Say It

**Correct:**
✅ "Path-SET" (like "upset" without the "up")
✅ "I'm using Path-SET for career exploration"

**Incorrect but understandable:**
⚠️ "Path-C-T-E" (spelling it out - acceptable in writing)
⚠️ "Path CTE" (saying as two words - we gently correct)

**Wrong (needs correction):**
❌ "Path-see-tee"
❌ "Path-kittie"
❌ "Path-cute"

### Script for Correcting Pronunciation
**In Person:**
"Great question about PathCTE - by the way, we say it 'Path-SET' because CTE stands for Career Technical Education, and we thought 'set your path' was perfect for what we do!"

**In Writing:**
"PathCTE (pronounced 'Path-SET') helps students explore careers..."

**In Videos:**
"Welcome to PathCTE - that's P-A-T-H-C-T-E, pronounced 'Path-SET'..."
