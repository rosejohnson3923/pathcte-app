## Architecture Differences

### What Plan Expected: Single Repo

The original plan showed a single-repo structure:
```
pathcte/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── services/
│   etc...
```

### What We Built: Monorepo

We implemented a monorepo with shared/web separation:
```
pathcte/
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/  (platform-agnostic)
│   └── web/     (React web app)
```

**Impact:** Positive
- Better code organization
- Ready for React Native mobile app
- Enforces separation of concerns
- Services are truly platform-agnostic

## Conclusion

**Current State:**
- Foundation is SOLID (100%)
- UI Components are GOOD (pathkeys & careers done)
- Database is COMPLETE (100%)
- Game System is MISSING (0%)

**To Reach Minimum Viable Product:**
- Complete Phase 5: Live Game System (22-26 hours)
- Complete Phase 4: Question Sets (17-22 hours)
- **Total: 39-48 hours of work**

**Recommendation:**
Stick to the Week 2 plan in NEXT_PRIORITIES.md:
1. Build game foundation (services + real-time)
2. Build game UI components
3. Implement Career Quest mode
4. Then move to question set creation

We are on track, just need to focus on the game system next.
