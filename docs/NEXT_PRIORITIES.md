# Recommended Next Priorities
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Current Status:** 79% MVP Complete, Database Layer at 95%

---

## Strategic Decision: Build UI Now, Services As Needed ‚úÖ

### Why This Approach Makes Sense:

1. **Generic Service is Sufficient** - Our supabase.service.ts can handle 95% of data operations
2. **Faster Visible Progress** - Users can see and interact with features
3. **Extract Services When Needed** - When UI logic gets complex, refactor into services
4. **Validates Requirements** - Building UI reveals what services actually need
5. **Maintains Momentum** - Keeps development moving forward

## Resource Allocation

### Your Time Investment
- **Week 1:** 19-26 hours (UI development)
- **Week 2:** 20-26 hours (Services + UI)
- **Week 3:** 17-24 hours (Gameplay completion)
- **Week 4:** 17-22 hours (Content creation - optional)

**Total to Functional MVP:** 56-76 hours (2-3 weeks at 25-30 hrs/week)

### What You Get
- ‚úÖ Students can view collections
- ‚úÖ Students can explore careers
- ‚úÖ Teachers can host games
- ‚úÖ Students can join games
- ‚úÖ Complete gameplay experience
- ‚úÖ Real-time multiplayer
- ‚úÖ Pathkeys awarded after games

### What You Don't Get (But Don't Need for MVP)
- ‚ùå Teachers creating content (can use pre-made sets)
- ‚ùå Market system (can award pathkeys directly)
- ‚ùå Advanced features (polish for later)

---

## Decision Framework

### Build This Component If:
1. ‚úÖ Core to user flow (join game, play game)
2. ‚úÖ High visibility (collection page, career page)
3. ‚úÖ Required for testing (can't test game without UI)
4. ‚úÖ Unblocks other features (lobby before gameplay)

### Defer This Component If:
1. ‚ùå Nice to have but not critical (animations, polish)
2. ‚ùå Can work around (use pre-made content vs. editor)
3. ‚ùå Low usage initially (settings page, profiles)
4. ‚ùå Optimization not blocker (can work without it)

---

## Conclusion

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead of Database Work:

1. **Week 1:** Build Pathkey & Career UI using existing hooks
2. **Week 2:** Build Game + Realtime services, then Game UI
3. **Week 3:** Complete gameplay and results
4. **Week 4:** (Optional) Build Question Editor with service

### Why This Works Better:

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Immediate visible progress
- ‚úÖ Validates data layer works
- ‚úÖ Reveals actual service needs
- ‚úÖ Gets to playable MVP faster
- ‚úÖ Can demo to users sooner

**The Missing 5% Database Work:**
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Build game + realtime services in Week 2
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Build question service in Week 4
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Build career/market services as polish later

**Time Saved:**
- Don't build services you don't need yet
- Don't build services until you know what they need
- Extract services from UI when logic gets complex

### üéØ Bottom Line:

**Skip the remaining 5% database work.** You have everything you need to build UI. Build the 2 critical services (game + realtime) alongside the game UI in Week 2, and build other services only when you actually need them.

**Start tomorrow with:** PathkeyCard.tsx üöÄ
