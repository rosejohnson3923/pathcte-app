**Features:**
- Create assignment with:
  - Career/question set selection
  - Due date
  - Class/student targeting
  - Point value
- Student notifications for new assignments
- Completion tracking and grading
- Late submission handling

**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours

---

#### 13. **Performance Optimization**

- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization (Azure CDN, responsive images)
