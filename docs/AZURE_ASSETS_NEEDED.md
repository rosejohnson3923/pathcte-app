## SQL Updates After Upload

```sql
-- Update pathkey image URLs
UPDATE pathkeys SET image_url = 'https://pathcte.blob.core.windows.net/pathkeys/DEV-001.png?{sas}' WHERE key_code = 'DEV-001';
UPDATE pathkeys SET image_url = 'https://pathcte.blob.core.windows.net/pathkeys/NURSE-001.png?{sas}' WHERE key_code = 'NURSE-001';
-- ... repeat for all pathkeys

-- Update career image URLs (using career_code derived from onet_code)
UPDATE careers SET image_url = 'https://pathcte.blob.core.windows.net/careers/software-developer/main.jpg?{sas}' WHERE onet_code = '15-1252.00';
UPDATE careers SET image_url = 'https://pathcte.blob.core.windows.net/careers/registered-nurse/main.jpg?{sas}' WHERE onet_code = '29-1141.00';
