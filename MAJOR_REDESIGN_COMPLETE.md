## 🎯 Before vs After Summary:

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Sidebar** | Plain white, basic links | Dark gradient, glowing active states, profile card |
| **Career Cards** | Flat, minimal | Dark cards, overlays, hover effects, badges on images |

## 🔥 Key Differentiators:

## 💡 Technical Notes:

- All components use Tailwind CSS utilities

- Animations use CSS transforms and transitions
- Hover states use `group` and `group-hover:`
- Gradients use `bg-gradient-to-*` patterns
- Shadows use multiple layers for depth

- Professional color schemes
- Layered visual depth

**The difference will be night and day once you restart the dev server!**
